        Mount Fuji, or <strong>Fujisan</strong>, is Japan's tallest and most iconic mountain,
        standing at an impressive 3,776 meters (12,389 feet). Located on Honshu
        Island, it lies near the boundary of Shizuoka and Yamanashi Prefectures,
        about 100 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. This stratovolcano is revered
        not only for its stunning symmetrical cone shape but also for its
        cultural and spiritual significance. As a sacred site in Japanese Shinto
        and Buddhist traditions, Mount Fuji has inspired countless works of art,
        literature, and poetry throughout history, symbolizing beauty, strength,
        and resilience. It is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park and was
        recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013 for its cultural
        importance.
